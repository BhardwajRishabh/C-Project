Create a JSON File which has URLs for 1000 Images. When Your Program Runs, It loads those URLs in Memory as  a List. Then Downloads Each Image, But does not save the file in local system, but keeps the image data as binary data in memory for all 1000 Images. After this initiial setup is completed. The program allows a user to enter a search word. It will search in the list of urls if it has a url containing the search word. If yes, it will ask user another qiuestion: Path where the image should be saved. When user provides the path, that Image is saved as png or jpeg whatever format it was originally in when downloaded, into that particular path entered by user.
